# Lighted Electric Poles for Factorio

This mod adds lighted versions of the small, medium, and big electric poles as well as a lighted substation.

The lighted small pole unlocks with the Optics technology.
The lighted medium and big pole unlock with the Electric Energy Distribution 1 technology.
The lighted substation unlocks with the Electric Energy Distribution 2 technology.

The poles support fast replace so they can be directly placed on top of the equivalent un-lit pole. Power consumption is 5kW, the same as an un-lit pole & small lamp combination.

Note that this mod is not currently compatible with FARL. FARL will place the pole, but the included light will not appear.
