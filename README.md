# Lighted Electric Poles for Factorio

This mod adds lighted versions of the small, medium, and big electric poles as well as a lighted substation.

The lighted small pole unlocks with the Optics technology.
The lighted medium and big pole unlock with the Electric Energy Distribution 1 technology.
The lighted substation unlocks with the Electric Energy Distribution 2 technology.

Power consumption is 5kW, the same as an un-lit pole & small lamp combination.


# Configuration
You can enabled or disable the visibility of the lamp that gets attached to the poles and substations
by editing config.lua and changing `lightedpoles_show_lamp` to `true` or `false` respectively.  


# Other Mod Support
## Bob's Power
If Bob's Power mod is installed lighted versions of all MK2, 3 and 4 power poles and substations 
will be enabled.  The recipes will be identical except the next tier will require the lighted version
of the previous tier.  The lighted versions are unlocked with the same technology that unlocks the unlit
versions.

## Bob's Electronics
If Bob's electronics are installed the recipe for the small lamp will be changed to only require a basic
circuit board instead of a basic electronic board so they can be built earlier.  This is the same change
that is made by ShinyBob by default.

## ShinyBob
If ShinyBob is installed the icons and entity pictures for the lighted versions will reflect the 
same color variations as the unlit versions.

# FARL
The lighted poles work with FARL assuming that the blueprint used includes the lighted version
